# Pollution Comparison Insights (Ahmedabad vs Vapi)
ðŸ“… Date: 2025-07-02 (22:00)

Based on the pollutant bar chart comparing Ahmedabad and Vapi, here are the key insights:

1. **PM2.5 and PM10 levels are significantly higher in Vapi**, indicating severe particulate pollution likely due to its industrial zone.
2. **NOâ‚‚ and SOâ‚‚ levels are relatively close** for both cities, suggesting traffic and industrial sources are common in both areas.
3. **Ahmedabad has a higher CO concentration** than Vapi, possibly due to higher vehicular density in the urban region of Maninagar.
4. **Oâ‚ƒ (Ozone) levels are higher in Ahmedabad**, pointing to more photochemical activity, possibly due to more urban sunlight exposure.
5. **Vapi suffers worse air quality in particulate matter**, while **Ahmedabad appears worse in gaseous pollutants**.

These insights will help shape our ML/DL modeling and Streamlit visualizations later in the project.
