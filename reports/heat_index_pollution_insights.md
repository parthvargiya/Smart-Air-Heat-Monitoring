# Day 4: Heat Index and Pollution Correlation Insights

## Correlation Matrix Observations:
- Due to limited data (only 2 cities), correlation values are either +1.0, -1.0, or undefined.
- **Temperature and Heat Index** show a perfect positive correlation (1.0) — as expected.
- **Humidity and Heat Index** show a strong negative correlation (-1.0), consistent with the heat index formula.
- **SO₂ and PM2.5** show varying trends between cities — industrial Vapi has higher values than urban Ahmedabad.

## Scatter Plot Insights:
- Scatter plots clearly show how each pollutant and temperature relate to the heat index across cities.
- Labels and color coding help differentiate city-level patterns.
- The comparison helps visualize pollution’s compounding effect on heat-related discomfort.

##  Next Step:
- Consider including an ideal city (e.g., Bengaluru) in future comparisons.
- Larger datasets will enable more reliable statistical correlations.
